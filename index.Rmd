## Bio

I am an aspiring physician-scientist who is passionate about improving 
accessibility of personalized medicine. My scientific interests range from computational
genomics method development for rare genetic disorders to bioinformatics of public health
data. I am currently exploring my clinical interests, which are constantly changing as I 
get further into my medical education. At the moment, I am particularly interested in 
exploring the fields of Clinical Genetics,Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Med-Peds, 
and Cardiology/Pulmonology. 

In my free time, I am an avid music-consumer; when I can do so in a Covid-conscious
manner, you can find me at music festivals and concerts or just at home singing
Broadway and Disney soundtracks to my cat, Ayanna. I identify as a board-game geek, a band nerd, choir
geek, and overall weirdo (in a good way). 

I do not have a Twitter at this time, but stay tuned as I am certain I will make an account soon.
