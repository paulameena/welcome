## Bio

I am an aspiring physician-scientist who is passionate about improving 
accessibility of personalized medicine. My scientific interests range from computational
genomics method development to bioinformatics of public health data. I am currently exploring 
the role of cell-cell fusion in cancer evolutionary trajectories and metastatic potential 
(with a particular emphasis on the evolution of chemotherapeutic resistance).
My clinical interest are constantly changing as I  get further into my medical education. 
At the moment, I am particularly interested in exploring the fields of Clinical Genetics,
Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Med-Peds,  and Ob/Gyn. 

In my free time, I am an avid music-consumer; when I can do so in a Covid-conscious
manner, you can find me at music festivals and concerts or just at home singing
Broadway and Disney soundtracks to my cat, Ayanna. I identify as a board-game geek, a band nerd, choir
geek, and overall weirdo (in a good way). 

I am most accessible via email! I have socials but I use them very sporadically.
